# github-javascript-actions

A repository for experimenting with and creating JavaScript GitHub actions.

## Development

When changes are made to the javascript source code, be sure to run `npm run build` to recompile the code into the dist/index.js file. This will execute the "build" script found in the `package.json` file in the root of the repository.
